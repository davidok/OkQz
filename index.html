					New York City's tech industry has seen incredible growth in recent years, with job growth jumping 33 percent between 2009 and 2013, according to a report by the state comptroller's office. The sector hired workers four times faster than any other industry in the city. However, a quick glance at the Equal Employment Opportunity reports of major companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter shows that the distribution of benefits from new opportunities is not equal across races and genders.

					As the city with the worst wealth gap in the entire country, New York City's "Silicon Alley" is creating new opportunities that pay 49 percent more than the city's average hourly wage of $26.50. The average pay for tech jobs is $39.50 per hour, according to a report prepared by HR&A Advisors called "The New York City Tech Ecosystem."

					The report states that New York City's tech "ecosystem" has outpaced the growth of both the city and the U.S. in terms of new jobs. This is no surprise, as venture capitalists have been investing billions into the industry.

					In 2014, venture capital firms invested $3.1 billion in tech companies, a 61-percent increase compared with 2013, according to "The Money Tree" report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, based on data from Thomson Reuters. Some investments are geared toward closing the diversity cap.

					This disparity is one that people like Tom O'Connell is attempting to fix. O'Connell is the program director of C/I, which has three meanings: Code/Interactive, Camp/Interactive and Career/Interactive. The organization's goal is to encourage under-served high school students to learn computing skills and to prepare them for jobs in the tech industry. O'Connell said he thinks that the reason for the diversity gap is because there simply aren't enough people of color or women available to fill the current available positions.

					"There's a huge education gap in a lot of schools we work in and in low-income schools in the country," he said. O'Connell's program is based in the Bronx, where the racial makeup of high schools is dominated by black and Hispanic students. O'Connell said he's seen students in his program express frustration when confronted with the challenges of coding -- stressed enough that they end up giving up.

				<div class="col-md-8">
					To address issue, C/I is set up as an incentive program for high schoolers aged 14 to 18 to climb to eventually intern at a major tech company. Code/Interactive is an after-school program in which students learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Those who show promise are invited to participate in the more intensive Camp/Interactive program where they can participate in Hackathons and further develop their products. The highest tier, Career/Interactive, pairs top students with companies where they can intern straight out of high school.

				<div class="col-md-8">
					C/I operates by training teachers to teach students how to code. O'Connell joined the organization two years ago as one of its first pilot teachers and helped to create training plans to speed up the learning process for teachers new to the program. Before C/I, O'Connell was a high school physics teacher in Houston, Texas, where he saw how students fared in STEM settings.

					"I always tell [recruiters], 'You're not going to go to a college recruiting fair and find diversity today. But if you take someone under your wing from high school, then you might find someone in a couple of years,'" O'Connell said. "Everybody has to do their part to make sure these students go into tech, or it's not going to happen."

					General Assembly, which began as a coworking space for startups nearly four years ago, has now expanded to 13 campuses worldwide where students attend classes to learn or develop programming skills, said Anna Lindow, digital marketing instructor for General Assembly. Students enroll to change careers or to improve their skills, she said, with classes ranging from $35 for one-time seminars to $10,500 for an intensive 10-week course on topics like user experience and product management.

					General Assembly students have gone on to work for companies like Spotify, The New York Times, JP Morgan and TD Ameritrade. In fact, the concept behind the organization's full-time courses -- which are held every day of the week -- is intended as "education until employment," Lindow said.

					As General Assembly expands, the organization continues to adapt to industry needs, offering fellowships to under-served groups -- people of color, women, veterans and those of lower income -- through its Opportunity Fund, which is supported by companies like CapitalOne, Microsoft and Google, as well as individual donors.

					"We've granted a bunch of fellowships," Lindow said. "The Fund is a way to cover the tuition of the program but also to give back to the community. We see it as a cycle." Fellows are required to commit more than 100 volunteer hours to a nonprofit as part of the program. [TK -- Fellows. Hoping to secure an interview this week.]
